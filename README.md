1- Tree Types Prediction Project

Predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).


2- Clustering (Customer Segmentation) Project

In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.


3- AutoScout Price Estimation Project

After data cleaning part, I tried different models to estimate the prices of the cars.
